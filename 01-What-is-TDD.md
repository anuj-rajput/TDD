# What is TDD
Test-driven development, or TDD is an iterative way to develop software by iteratively making many small changes backed by tests.

1. Write a failing test
2. Make the test pass
3. Refactor
4. Repeat

This is called the TDD cycle. It ensures you throughly and accurately test your code because the development is... driven by testing!

## Why should you use TDD?

TDD promotes good quality of code and overall better software engineering. Tests is how other engineering disciplines also ensure quality of their products. TDD eliminates regressions and defects
