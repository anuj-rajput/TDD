# What is TDD
Test-driven development, or TDD is an iterative way to develop software by iteratively making many small changes backed by tests.

1. Write a failing test
2. Make the test pass
3. Refactor
4. Repeat

This is called the TDD cycle. It ensures you throughly and accurately test your code because the development is... driven by testing!

## Why should you use TDD?
